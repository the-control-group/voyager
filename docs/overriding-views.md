# Overriding Views

You can override any of the BREAD views by creating a new folder in `resources/views/vendor/voyager/slug-name` and *slug-name* will be the *slug* that you have assigned for that table. There are 2 files that you will include in each which will be:

 - browse.blade.php
 - edit-add.blade.php
